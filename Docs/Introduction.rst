**Introduction**
------------------- 
WebAlign is an online tool for spatial registration of histological section images from rodent brains to reference 3D atlases.
Different experimental datasets registered to the same reference atlas allows you to spatially integrate, analyse and navigate these datasets within a standardised coordinate system.
The output of WebAlign can be used for analysis in the online QUINT workflow.
